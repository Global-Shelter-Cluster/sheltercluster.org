Environments

Dev: integration server. Checked out on the dev branch. A Github webhook triggers a script that keeps
the code updated whenever the branch is updated.

Stage: the next version of production where QA is performed. Checked out on the stage branch.
A Github webhook is configured similarly to dev.

Prod: checked out on the current release tag. When we are ready to deploy, the stage branch gets merged
into master, master gets tagged, and the tag gets deployed to production.

YouTrack board

Our board has 5 columns, I propose changing "Can't reproduce" to "In QA".
PROPOSED, READY, IN PROGRESS, IN QA, DONE

Proposed: tickets that we describe work that needs to be done, but that requires discussion. Can't start developing until those discussions take place.

Ready: development can start on those, but nobody is assigned.

In progress: someone is assigned, typically a developer.

In QA: the branch has been merged into the QA environment and the ticket is assigned to the designated QA team member.

Done: Feature branch has been merged into the stage branch and will get deployed with the next production tag.

Git
Each ticket gets a feature branch. The naming convention is [ticket type]/[number]-[small description],
e.g. cosmetics/16-page-width, feature/31-documents-pages.

Feature branches get merged into the dev branch and stage branches for QA.

A tag is made out of master when we want to deploy to production.
Tag names start with the letter "v" and are version numbers, for example v1.2.2.
Always increment the third number for a release, unless it contains a major functionality improvement,
in which case increment the second number (e.g. v1.3).

Deploying
cd /var/www/redc-001 && sudo -u apache git fetch --tags && sudo -u apache git checkout TAG_NAME
